An Inscryption mod that adds a talking Cat card into Act 1 and Kaycee's Mod.
He can be found randomly via. random card draws or trader's inventories. I'd like to add him as a static encounter, like the other talking cards, but until I learn how that is unavaliable.

Jackalope has unique lore, animated portraits, a unique voice pitch, and unique dialogue for nearly every in-game situational (excluding between-cards conversations, e.g. Stoat and Stinkbug talking to each other)

# Installation
This modâ€™s dependencies are BepInEx, the InscryptionAPI, JSONCardLoader and TalkingCardAPI.

I am 90% sure this mod DOES NOT function with Orochi_Umbra's amazing NodeBane mod, unfortunately.
